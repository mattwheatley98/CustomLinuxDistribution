# Custom Linux Distribution

This is a custom Linux distro intended to be used with a Raspberry Pi 4. The distro was created using Yocto Project and an RPI4 BSP. Intended to be used to supplement a different project, or as a standalone project in the future, this distro is customized to be lightweight and able to support projects using I2C and WiFi.

**Please note that this repository includes my custom layer and only the .conf files from my build environment, despite Poky and the RPI4's BSP being referenced in bblayers.conf!**

The main features of this distro include:

1. **Enabled I2C Port & WiFi** 
2. **Custom Binary Applications**

Please refer below for demonstrations of each feature:
